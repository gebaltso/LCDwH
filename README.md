The present work is describing Hint Enhancement Framework(HEF) 
that applies a two-step procedure to discover the community of the hint(s):
1) it changes the network by amplifying the hint(s) using re-weighting or re-wiring 
strategies so as to materialize the bias towards them and 2) it applies local 
community detection algorithms on the altered network of step 1.

In the framework we use already known algorithms for local community detection,
but they are implemented by us and not given by the original works authors.

The file someone needs to run in order to test the framework is the main.py
providing the right graph, seedset and community files.
